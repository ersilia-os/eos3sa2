# ProtoNet pre-trained network embedding based on the FS-Mol dataset for few-shot learning

## Model identifiers
- Slug: fs-mol-protonet
- Ersilia ID: eos3sa2
- Tags: Embedding, Few-shot

## Model description

This model provides a 512-dimensional embedding based on the last distance layer of the Prototypical Network (ProtoNet). The pre-trained model is provided by FS-Mol, a dataset for few-shot learning

- Input: COMPOUND (Single SMILES string)
- Output: Descriptor (The output is a 512-dimensional embedding that can be used for distance calculation or as an input for machine learning predictions)
- Model type: Classification
- Training set: ChEMBL27 (233786 training samples)
- Mode of training: Pre-trained
